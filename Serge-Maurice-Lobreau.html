                        Serge became Founder and Chairman of Sapian Group and Founder and CEO of Flash Group in 2015,
                        with a vision from past banking and wealth management experiences, to build a value add solution
                        for the Banked, unbanked and under banked population, with cutting edge solutions to enable the
                        company mantra of “financial inclusion and beyond.”
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Serge Maurice Lobreau's journey thus far was no easy walk in the park. Being born in the
                        politically troubled Republic of Congo, known for its mining and precious metals resources, he
                        eventually managed to leave to France with his family in 1989, at the young age of 10, for
                        further education. His entrepreneurial skills were visible at a very young age, as he started
                        working at a local radio station in Paris, selling radio marketing ads. He also did various
                        services for UHNWIs, requiring exposure via media and social marketing. Despite having a part
                        time work whilst studying, he managed to successfully complete 3 degrees, and with dedicated
                        commitment to graduate, he achieved BA in Law, Economics and Finance. He then continued to a
                        Masters in International Financial markets, which specialised in financial control and
                        derivatives markets. This formed a sound foundation in his future career in client management,
                        banking, hedge fund management and entrepreneurship.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        His 15 years of experience started within the hedge fund sector, where due to his excellent
                        thesis started during his Master’s degree on derivative based wealth creation, made its way to
                        being head hunted to another important role to sell major restructuring and derivatives based
                        financial products at a country level. Wishing to change from that highly political sector, he
                        explored the popular technology sector to work for Microsoft at their European HQ in Ireland, as
                        a project manager which created a strong foundation for his career in technology. However, it
                        brought him back to his calling into the banking world again, working with major international
                        banks.

                    As he started a new family, he then decided to move back to France and work for Credit Agricole.
                    Throughout his banking and wealth management career, managing over $2.5 B in AUM and over 800
                    corporate accounts with a minimum turnover of €12M, Serge was always on top of his game as a
                    leading account manager. Some of his tasks and responsibilities in this corporate finance role
                    ranged from economic modelling, banking, risk management, financial planning and wealth
                    management, dealing with institutions and UHNWIs, The later part of that time at credit
                    Agricole, he was introduced to network marketing of products which managed to succeed with ease
                    due to his client management and relationship skills, earning a six figure income monthly on a
                    part time basis. The income and lifestyle made him start his full time entrepreneur journey,
                    with a move to Gold mines from a request made by a former client. He reconnected to his roots
                    and relatives in the republic of Congo, to commence the Gold trading business.

                <p>
                    Like all serial entrepreneurs, Serge too had his ups and downs, with several challenges in
                    business. He wisened up over time, always stronger and more positive, towards his vision
                    development. The passion to continuous development led him to the blockchain and crypto currency
                    certification as Blockchain architect. He spent the next 2 years learning and researching
                    various businesses that included gold mining, gold refining and asset management, real estate,
                    network marketing, blockchain, crypto currencies, fashion, hospitality and even eco water
                    production systems for the poor in Africa.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Serge is currently a recognised blockchain and asset pegged token founder of Flash Group, with
                    its ICO that raised $72M in July 2018, with one of the earliest gold pegged coins in the world,
                    the OZTG. The ecosystem of the Flash Group and Sapian Group is much talked about in the industry
                    at various thought leaders blockchain, cryptocurrency and DeFi conferences globally. The
                    financial wealth creation, health and even corporate social responsibility based ecosystem of
                    the group of companies is the envy of many startups in such a short space of time. Like any
                    startup and innovative visionary company that wishes to make a difference in the world and add
                    value, his stubborn attention to detail on the clients’ user interface and experience has led to
                    some truly quality products recently launched, and several more in the pipeline to follow. The
                    group is now poised to grow and rollout various health and wealth related products and services,
                    via a unique network marketing model, which Serge understands like no other in the marketplace.
