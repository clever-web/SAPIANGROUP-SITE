                <h5 class="accentText mt-5">3. How and Why We Use Personal Data</h5>

                <p style="text-align-last: left !important;">Personal data will be collected, held, used and disclosed
                    for the following purposes jointly and/or
                    severally:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>to provide you with Services;</li>
                    <li>to identify you;</li>
                    <li>to further develop and improve our Services;</li>
                    <li>to monitor and analyse trends and better understand how users interact with our Services;</li>
                    <li>to communicate with you and keep you updated about our Services;</li>
                    <li>to monitor and prevent any risks with our Services;</li>
                    <li>to process any requests;</li>
                    <li>to resolve disputes;</li>
                    <li>to the extent permissible or necessary by law, for any other purpose as may be deemed reasonably
                        necessary by Sapian Group in the circumstances.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5 class="accentText mt-5">4. What Are the Legal Grounds for Collecting and Using Personal Data?</h5>

                <p style="text-align-last: left !important;">Sapian Group collects and uses personal data under Estonian
                    and EU data protection laws.</p>

                <p style="text-align-last: left !important;">The legal grounds for use and collection of personal data
                    are based on the following:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>when you have given consent (e.g. for newsletter subscription);</li>
                    <li>the use is necessary for protection of your or other users’ vital interests;</li>
                    <li>the use is necessary under a legal obligation;</li>
                    <li>when we use our personal data in order to fulfil our commitments to you;</li>
                    <li>when we have legitimate interests in using your information (e.g. to provide you with the
                        Services,
                        improve our Services, communicate with you, monitor and prevent any problems).</li>
                </ul>

                <p style="text-align-last: left !important;">Where we rely on your consent to process personal data, you
                    have the right to withdraw or decline
                    your
                    consent at any time and where we rely on legitimate interests, you have the right to object.</p>

                <h5 class="accentText mt-5">5. Minors</h5>

                <p style="text-align-last: left !important;">Sapian Group does not knowingly provide Services and
                    collect personal information from anyone under 18
                    years
                    of age. Our Services are available only to the users over 18 years old. If we learn that we have
                    collected the personal information of a child under 13, or equivalent minimum age depending on
                    jurisdiction, we will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible.</p>

                <h5 class="accentText mt-5">6. Sharing your Personal Data</h5>

                <p style="text-align-last: left !important;">We do not sell our users’ personal data or share your
                    personal data with any third parties except for
                    the purpose of provision of the Services. When we provide you with the Services, we may share your
                    personal data as described below.</p>

                <p style="text-align-last: left !important;">Sapian Group may share your information with:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>our employees and independent contractors who reasonably need to access your personal data to
                        deliver
                        some Services;</li>
                    <li>legal and regulatory authorities, as required by applicable laws and regulations;</li>
                    <li>our auditors, lawyers, accountants, consultants and other professional advisors, where it is
                        reasonably necessary for obtaining advice, professional services, or managing legal disputes;
                    </li>
                    <li>business transfers in connection with any merger, sale of company assets, or acquisition of all
                        or
                        a
                        portion of our business by another company.</li>
                </ul>

                <p style="text-align-last: left !important;">If any of these events happen, this Privacy Policy would
                    continue to apply to your information and
                    the
                    party receiving your information may continue to use your information, but only in compliance with
                    this
                    Privacy Policy.</p>

                <p style="text-align-last: left !important;">This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of
                    service providers and other third parties that
                    we
                    do not own or control, or individuals that we do not employ or manage.</p>

                <h5 class="accentText mt-5">7. Sensitive Data</h5>

                <p style="text-align-last: left !important;">We do not collect or request your sensitive data
                    (including, but not limited to, information about
                    your
                    religious or political beliefs, opinions). Where you have provided it to us voluntarily, you shall
                    be
                    solely responsible for security of any sensitive data, and we do not intend to use this data for any
                    purpose, nor share this data with any third parties. Please do not post or add sensitive and other
                    personal data that you would not want to be publicly available.</p>

                <h5 class="accentText mt-5">8. Users’ Rights in relation to its Personal Data</h5>

                <p style="text-align-last: left !important;">You may access your personal data held by us to correct,
                    update and remove inaccurate or incorrect
                    data.
                    You have the following rights:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>delete some or all personal data that we held about you;</li>
                    <li>change or correct your personal data that we held about you;</li>
                    <li>object to, or limit or restrict, use of your personal data;</li>
                    <li>right to access and/or take your personal data: you can ask us for a copy of your personal
                        information
                        in machine readable form;</li>
                    <li>ask not to use your personal data for marketing purposes;</li>
                    <li>access information we hold about you.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5 class="accentText mt-5">9. Security of Personal Data</h5>

                <p style="text-align-last: left !important;">We use certain technologies to ensure the confidentiality
                    of your personal data. Sapian Group uses several
                    security measures, including, without limitation, SSL method, two-faction authentication, PCI
                    scanning
                    and internal data access restrictions to protect your personal data.</p>

                <p style="text-align-last: left !important;">However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or
                    method of electronic storage is 100% secure.
                    While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal data, we cannot
                    guarantee
                    absolute security of your personal data.</p>

                <h5 class="accentText mt-5">10. Data Retention</h5>

                <p style="text-align-last: left !important;">We process information both inside and outside of the
                    European Union and European Economic Area and
                    rely
                    on legally-provided mechanisms to lawfully transfer information across borders. Countries where we
                    process information may have laws which are different, and potentially not as protective, as the
                    laws of
                    your own country.</p>

                <p style="text-align-last: left !important;">We retain your personal data for as long as your account is
                    in existence or necessary to fulfil the
                    purposes for which we collect it or as needed to provide you with the services, except if required
                    otherwise by law. However, when your account is terminated for any reason, we will delete your
                    personal
                    information entirely.</p>

                <p style="text-align-last: left !important;">In some cases we may determine the period of data retention
                    based on the period we need to access the
                    data for the provision of services, receiving payment, resolving your customer support issues or for
                    any
                    other auditing or legal purposes. Retention periods may be changed from time to time based on
                    regulatory
                    requirements.</p>

                <h5 class="accentText mt-5">11. Communications</h5>

                <p style="text-align-last: left !important;">The email notifications sent by Sapian Group are of two
                    types:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>system notification sent by the Website via email (examples of such emails may include
                        registration
                        confirmation, verification emails, or any other emails that are required to operate your
                        account);</li>
                    <li>product and service notifications that you directly subscribed to.</li>
                </ul>

                <p style="text-align-last: left !important;">It should be noted that you may not unsubscribe from system
                    notification emails as these emails
                    contain
                    important user information and are sent for your legitimate interests. You may unsubscribe from
                    product
                    and service notifications any time by visiting an opt-out page. Such notifications contain
                    information
                    about our Website updates, new services and products added as well as other notifications for
                    information use only.</p>

                <h5 class="accentText mt-5">12. Changes to the Privacy Policy</h5>

                <p style="text-align-last: left !important;">We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. As
                    soon as the Privacy Policy is updated, Sapian Group
                    will post an updated version of the Privacy Policy on the Website. The new Privacy Policy becomes
                    effective from the moment it is posted or updated on our Website. We will send you an email
                    notification
                    to alert you about such changes.</p>
